## 🪶 About the Project

**MORENGY** is a 3D fighting game inspired by *Morengy*, the traditional Malagasy martial art practiced across Madagascar — especially in the **North** (Diego Suarez, Ambanja, Nosy Be, etc.).  

The game’s purpose is to:
- Promote Malagasy culture and values of respect, honor, and courage.  
- Showcase **real fighters**, both veterans and young warriors, preserving their legacy.  
- Bring *Morengy* to the digital world with cinematic fights, music, and environments inspired by Madagascar’s landscapes.

## 🌍 Vision

> “Reviving the spirit of Morengy — a tradition of respect, strength, and unity — through technology and art.”

**Objectives:**
- Celebrate Malagasy identity and history  
- Bridge tradition and innovation through gaming  
- Inspire the next generation of Malagasy developers and artists
