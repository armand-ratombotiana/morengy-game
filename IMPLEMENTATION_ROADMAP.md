# 🎯 Morengy Game - Implementation Roadmap

**Decision:** Fast to Market - Unity Premium with **Online Multiplayer**
**Focus:** Complete fighting game with single-player AND competitive online play
**Date:** January 13, 2025 (Updated)
**Timeline:** **7-8 months** (28 weeks)

---

## 📋 Strategic Decision Summary

### ✅ Chosen Path: Unity Premium with Multiplayer at Launch

**Why Include Multiplayer:**
1. **Competitive Scene:** Fighting games thrive with online versus
2. **Replayability:** Online extends game life significantly
3. **Community Building:** Ranked matchmaking creates engaged community
4. **Value Proposition:** $19.99 justified by full online experience
5. **Market Expectation:** Modern fighting games need online day 1

**Timeline Extension:**
- Original plan: 4-5 months (single-player only)
- **New timeline: 7-8 months** (includes rollback netcode + matchmaking)

**Additional Investment:**
- Development: +$4,000 (networking specialist, 80 hours)
- Monthly costs: $10-210/month (PlayFab scales with users)
- Extended testing: +4 weeks (alpha/beta)

**Strategic Tradeoffs Maintained:**
- ❌ Not using Unreal Engine 5 (Unity has good netcode solutions)
- ✅ Will upgrade URP → HDRP for better visuals
- ✅ Motion matching alternatives via Unity plugins/Mixamo
- ✅ Focus on unique AI + cultural authenticity + rollback netcode quality
- ❌ F2P conversion only if game proves successful (premium at launch)
